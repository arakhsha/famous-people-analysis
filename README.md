# An Analysis of Globally Famous People
This is an analysis of globally famous people mostly based on [Pantheon Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/28201)<sup>1</sup>. This dataset contains information about people whose Wikipedia page is available in more than 25 languages. We take a closer look at their occupations, nationalities, and when they lived. We also eveluate the impact of nationality on fame by comparing the scientific contributions from the Human Accomplishment<sup>2</sup> with the Wikipedia data.

# An Analysis of Globally Famous People
This project is an analysis of globally famous people, mostly based on [Pantheon Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/28201)<sup>1</sup>. This dataset contains information about people whose Wikipedia page is available in more than 25 languages. Their occupations, nationalities, and when they have lived is studied. We also evaluate the impact of birthplace and date on fame by comparing the scientific contributions from the Human Accomplishment<sup>2</sup> with the Wikipedia data.

I proposed this project for university Data Analysis course, and tied for first place among 70+ participants by receiving perfect score. You can find the final report in persian [here](https://arakhsha.github.io/da_report.html).
